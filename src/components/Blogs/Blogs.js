            <p><br/>Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source 
            JavaScript runtime environment that enables JavaScript to be run on the server.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting 
                language that is used to build dynamic HTML pages with interactive effects on a webpage.<br/>
                On the other hand, Node.js usually represents a list of objects and methods accessible to
                 JavaScript code when run in the V8 engine or via the node interpreter</p>
                 <p></p>
